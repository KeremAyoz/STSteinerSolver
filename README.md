# ST-Steiner Solver

- Repeatedly finds the minimum Steiner tree for the given network files.(ap1, ap2, bp1, bp2, n1, n2, n3)

# Running

```shell
$ cd solver
$ python solver.py
```

- Resulting networks could be found in /ST-Steiner-env/ST-Steiner/clusters
- Input networks are in ST-Steiner-env/ST-Steiner/data
